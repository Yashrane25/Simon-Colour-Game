# Simon Game:-
This project is a recreation of the classic Simon memory game, where players test their memory by following an increasingly complex sequence of colors. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Game Rules:-
The game starts when the player presses any key.
A random sequence of colors will flash, starting with one color.
The player must replicate the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
If the player correctly follows the sequence, the game progresses to the next level, adding one more color to the sequence.
If the player makes a mistake, the game will display the final score and reset, allowing the player to start over.

###Features:-
Progressive Difficulty: Each correct sequence completion advances the player to a higher level with an additional color in the sequence.
High Score Tracking: The game displays the playerâ€™s current score and keeps track of the highest score achieved during the session.
Visual Effects: Button flashes and background color changes enhance the gaming experience.
